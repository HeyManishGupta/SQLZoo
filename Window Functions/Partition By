The 2015 election is a different PARTITION to the 2017 election. We only care about the order of votes for each year.


Question
--------
Use PARTITION to show the ranking of each party in S14000021 in each year. Include yr, party, votes and ranking (the party with the most votes is 1).


Query
------

SELECT yr,
       party,
       votes,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY yr
                    ORDER BY votes DESC) AS posn
FROM ge
WHERE constituency = 'S14000021'
ORDER BY party,
         yr;
